# Flutter Zero To Hero

As I learned Flutter development, I created several projects to showcase my growing skills with this versatile framework:

- [**Ninja Trips**](https://github.com/bilalBakhrom/flutter-zero-to-hero/tree/master/world_time) - I focused on mastering Flutter animations in this project.
- [**World Time**](https://github.com/bilalBakhrom/flutter-zero-to-hero/tree/master/world_time) - This app demonstrates my ability to use external data sources and APIs in Flutter, providing real-time information from different time zones.
- [**Quotes**](https://github.com/bilalBakhrom/flutter-zero-to-hero/tree/master/qutoes) - In the Quotes project, I expanded my knowledge by using Row and Column widgets, creating local packages, and becoming proficient in using padding and margin effectively.
- [**Ninja ID**](https://github.com/bilalBakhrom/flutter-zero-to-hero/tree/master/ninja_id) - The Ninja ID app shows my progress in creating a polished user interface and refining my skills with both StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget widgets.
- [**Flutter Net Ninja**](https://github.com/bilalBakhrom/flutter-zero-to-hero/tree/master/flutter_net_ninja) - This project marks the beginning of my Flutter journey, where I learned the basics of creating a Flutter project and gained insights into working with widgets.

These projects demonstrate my practical experience in Flutter development and highlight my commitment to continuous learning and improvement in this dynamic field.
